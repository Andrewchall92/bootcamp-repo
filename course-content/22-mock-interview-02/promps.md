1. rotate the elements in the arr
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
n = 3
results should be 4,5,6,1,2,3

loop over the arr n times
shift arr and get first element
push first element to the original arr
return arr after n shifts

2. given a stack with push, pop, empty
delete the middle of the stack without using additional data structures


counter = 0
while stack.empty !== false
stack.pop counter ++ 
push into new stack
stack.length/2
use math.floor to round
stack
